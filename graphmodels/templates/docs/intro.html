                A dataset is a selection of your data you want to analysis using one of the graphical models.
                The data file to be uploaded should be in a particular format, please refer to <a href="/docs/dataset/">this page</a>
                for a detailed view of the data format. Using the configuration panel when uploading new datasets, 
                you should correctly set the required fields including the separator, header information and access limitation 
                for the System to analysis properly. In addition, you could write some description for your dataset as well.

                <span>Select a model</span>
                The system currently provides three graphical models: the <code>glasso</code> (Graphical Lasso) model, 
                the <code>CLIME</code> model and the <code>TIGER</code> model, amongest the TIGER model is thought to be state-of-the-art.
                We provide the possibility for users to tune the model by setting their own runtime options.
                Parameter tuning shall be important for models like glasso and CLIME. The TIGER
                model, however, reserves the tuning-insensitive property that can save a lot of tuning work.
                The interface for users to upload new models is not fulfilled yet, if you want to submit 
                your own graphical model, please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.

                <p>
                <span>Create a task</span>
                With a simple click, you can run one of the Graphical Models the system provided on a dataset.
                The dataset will be analysed and result(the inverse covariance matrix) will be visualized. Using the configuration panel
                when creating new tasks, you could set runtime options and access limitation of that task.

                Two visualization manners are supported by our service. One is the interaction manner, and another is static. 
                In order to create interactive visualizations, we adopted the <code>Infovis</code> toolkit, which is a javascript library 
                for visualizing various types of data. For the static one, we used the <code>Circos</code> software.
